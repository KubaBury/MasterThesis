\section{Overview}
Machine learning models can be classified into two main categories, discriminative and generative models. Simply put, a discriminative model makes predictions based on conditional probability $p\left(y|\bx\right)$ and is used for classification or regression problems. In other words, discriminative models distinguishes the decision boundary between the
classes.  It corresponds to learning parameters that maximize the conditional probability
distribution $p(y|\bx)$. On the contrary, a generative model revolves around the distribution of a data set to return a probability for a given example. Rather than
looking at classes and trying to find something to separate them, it focuses
only on the one class at the time and builds a model what that certain class looks like, then turns attention to the other class. To express it more formally, generative models learn parameters that maximize $p\left(\bx|y \right)$ and $p\left(y\right)$. Since
\begin{align}\label{eq:prob_decompostion}
p\left(\bx,y\right) = p\left(\bx|y\right)\cdot p\left(y\right),
\end{align}
with joint PDF it is possible to generate new $\left(\bx',y'\right)$ pairs. In some cases, the use of the second decomposition $p\left(\bx,y\right) = p\left(y|\bx\right)\cdot p\left(\bx\right)$ is also an option.  Note that in an unsupervised setting, the task is reduced to inferring only $p\left(\bx\right)$.

\section{Discriminative modeling}
In this section, we review the basics of discriminative modeling proposed in \cite{HDGEmain}. Given a data distribution through the probability density $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ and a label distribution with probability density $p(y|\boldsymbol{x})$ containing $C$ categories. In this thesis, we focus on classification problems, where the label $y$ is now a qualitative variable, taking on $C$ possible values, and comes from a finite set $\pazocal{C}$.  A classification problem is typically solved using a parametric function $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} : \mathbb{R}^D \to \pazocal{C}$, where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ denotes the parameters of the model. In practice, the function $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is often used in the form of $\mathbb{R}^D \to  \mathbb{R}^C$. This function maps each data point $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$ to $C$ real-valued numbers known as logits. It should be noted that $\mathbb{R}^C$ is allowed here due to the utilization of \emph{one-hot encoding}, which will be explained in Section \ref{OHE}. Logits are used to parameterize a categorical distribution through the function.
\begin{equation}\label{softmax}
	q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right) = \frac{\exp\left({f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)[y]}\right)}{\sum_{y\in\pazocal{C}}\exp\left({f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)[y]}\right)},
\end{equation}
which is known as the Softmax function. Note that the convention $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)[y]$ means the element $y^{\mathrm{th}}$ of $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)$. For learning $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is usually minimized cross-entropy loss 
\begin{equation}\label{crossentropy}
     \mathrm{CE}\left(\bt\right)=-\mathbb{E}_{p_{\mathrm{data}}\left(y,\bx\right)}\left[\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)\right] \approx -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i\right).
\end{equation} 
The rationale for this objective comes from minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with a target distribution $p(y| \boldsymbol{x})$ \cite{KL}. In general, the
KL divergence (or KL distance) from $p(y| \boldsymbol{x})$ to $q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KLdiv}
D_{\mathrm{KL}} \left(p(y| \boldsymbol{x}) || q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right) \right) = \int p(y| \boldsymbol{x})\log\frac{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)}\d{y} = \mathbb{E}_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})} \left[\log\frac{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \right]
\end{equation}
and has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\KL{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \geq 0,$
\item $\KL{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)} = 0$ iff $p(y| \boldsymbol{x}) = q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$ almost everywhere,
\item $\KL{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \neq \KL{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)}{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}$ and KL divergence does not obey the triangle inequality.
\end{enumerate}
The third property indicates that care is needed in the syntax describing KL divergence. We say that \eqref{eq:KLdiv} is from $p(y| \boldsymbol{x})$ to $q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$. Using the logarithmic property, \eqref{eq:KLdiv} can be further rewritten in the form 
\begin{equation}
	 \mathbb{E}_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})} \left[\log\frac{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}{q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \right] = 
	 \mathbb{E}_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})} \left[\log p(y| \boldsymbol{x}) \right] - \mathbb{E}_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})} \left[\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right) \right],
	\end{equation}
where subscript $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ emphasizes that $q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$ is the approximative density we get to control. Note that
the first term does not depend on $\bt$ and therefore minimizing either CE or KL divergence is equivalent. Finally, by minimizing with respect to $\bt$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} D_{\mathrm{KL}} \left(p(y| \boldsymbol{x}) \Vert q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right) \right) = \min_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} - \E_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}\left[ \log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
For clarity, the expected value will be discussed. In practice, it is dealt with discrete data, so the term $\E_{ p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)\right]$ takes the form of
\begin{equation}
    \E_{p(y| \boldsymbol{x})}\left[\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)\right] \approx \sum_{k=1}^C p(y_k| \boldsymbol{x})\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y_k|\boldsymbol{x}\right).
\end{equation}
This part deserves further discussion for a few reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation  of $\bt$ is equivalent to minimizing the KL distance.
    \item One may encounter the concepts of minimization or maximization of CE.
\end{itemize}
To address these reasons, it is necessary to briefly review the ML estimation. The principle of ML assumes that the most reasonable
values for $\bt$ are those for which the probability of the observed sample is
highest. Since $q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$ is model PDF, we have to follow the objective function
\begin{equation}
   \pazocal{L}\left(\bt^{}\right)= \sum_{i=1}^{N}\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i\right).
\end{equation}
Further optimization of $\pazocal{L}\left(\bt\right)$ gives 
\begin{align}
    \widehat{\bt}_{\mathrm{ML}} &= \argmax_{\bt} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i\right)\\  
    &=\argmin_{\bt} -\sum_{i=1}^{N}\log q_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\left(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i\right).
\end{align}

\subsection{One--hot encoding}\label{OHE}
 Machine learning (ML) algorithms can misinterpret the numeric values of labels if there exists any hierarchy between them. One--hot encoding is a very common approach for dealing with this issue, in order to improve the algorithm performance. Each unique category value is transformed into a new column and these dummy variables are then filled up with 0 or 1 (0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE). For the sake of clarity, the transformation of a label encoding into a one--hot encoding is illustrated in the following table \ref{tab:OHE}. 
 
 However, this method has its own downsides. For example, it creates new variables and if there exist many unique category values, models have to deal with a large number of predictors, causing the so-called \emph{Big-p problem} \cite{Bigp}. Also, one--hot encoding causes multicolinearity between the individual variables, which may lead to reducing the model's accuracy.

\subsection{Noise--contrastive estimation}
Suppose one has to estimate a model that is specified by an non-normalized probability density function $q^0_{\bt}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)$. In such a case, one can utilize noise--contrastive estimation (NCE). The first step is to introduce another parameter $c$ among the estimated parameters $\bt$. For clarity, the symbol $\bt^\star=\left\lbrace\bt^{},c^{}_{}\right\rbrace$ is introduced for the set of estimated parameters, including
$c$. Using this notation, the following equality hold
\begin{align}
    \log q_{\bt^\star}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right) = \log q_{\bt^\star}^0\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right) + c,
    \end{align}
which means that the newly introduced parameter $c$ is an estimate of the negative logarithm of
the normalization constant $Z\left(\bt\right)$.
As the name suggests, we use noise to estimate. By our convention, let $\bx_1,\bx_2,\dots,\bx_N$
be the observations and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_1,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_2,\dots,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_N$ be the artificially generated noise data with known distribution $\psi\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right)$. The estimate $\widehat{\bt^\star}$ is then defined as
\begin{align}
    \widehat{\bt^\star} &= \argmax_{\bt^\star} \pazocal{L}^{\mathrm{NC}}\left(\bt^\star\right)\\
   &= \argmax_{\bt^\star} \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log S_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx_i\right) + \log\left(1-S_{\bt^\star}\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_i\right) \right)\label{NCEloss}\\
   &= \argmin_{\bt^\star} -\frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^N \log S_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx_i\right) + \log\left(1-S_{\bt^\star}\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_i\right) \right)
\end{align}
where $S_{\bt^\star}$ stands for a logistic function,
\begin{align}
S_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx\right) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-G_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx\right) \right)}
\end{align}
and finally, the function $G_{\bt^\star}$ represents the difference of the log-likelihoods of $q_{\bt^\star}$ and $\psi$, hence 
\begin{align}
    G_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx\right) = \log q_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx \right) - \log\psi\left(\bx \right).
\end{align}
It may be noted that equation \eqref{NCEloss} also appears in SL tasks and is called binary
CE loss. It is actually a special case of CE itself. Thus, it is used for the classification of two classes. This gives an intuitive insight into how noise--contrastive estimation
really works. When data and noise are compared, the model is learned, so this method can be called
learning by comparison. This approach does not use labels, so it is an UL algorithm. 

\begin{example}[One--dimensional Gaussian distribution]
To test this approach, we performed a simple experiment. There are a total of $N = 100$ i.i.d. and one-dimensional observations $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N$ from an unknown distribution that is assumed to be non--normalized and Gaussian. Therefore, it is of the form
\begin{align}\label{eq:NCE_datadist1}
    q_{\bt^\star}\left(x\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{\left(x-\mu\right)^2}{\sigma^2} + c \right),
\end{align} 
where $\bt^\star = \left\lbrace \mu, \sigma^2, c \right\rbrace$. Next, we artificially generate noise data $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_N$, which is again easier to do using a Gaussian distribution. This means that it can be chosen, for example,
\begin{align}\label{eq:NCE_noisedist1}
    \psi\left(e\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi 10}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{e^2}{10} \right).
\end{align}
We choose the noise PDF intentionally so widely spread from its mean value because these two PDFs, i.e. \eqref{eq:NCE_datadist1} and \eqref{eq:NCE_noisedist1}, should at least partially overlap. At this point, we have all the components available and it is possible to construct a function $-\pazocal{L}^{\mathrm{NC}}\left(\bt^\star\right)$ that is minimized by using stochastic gradient descent. The following figure shows the training process and the comparison between
the estimated distribution and the true one. As can be seen in Figure \ref{ex:NCE_1}, this approach works quite well, and for more observations, the results would be even better. Also, the minimization of $-\pazocal{L}^{\mathrm{NC}}\left(\bt^\star\right)$ is very fast.

\end{example}

\begin{example}[Two--dimensional Gaussian distribution]
The one--dimensional case may seem too simple, and therefore an example with a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution was performed. The experimental setup remains nearly the same; only the dimensionality of the problem differs. 

Recall that the non--normalized multivariate Gaussian distribution in $\R^2$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
   q_{\bt^\star}\left(\bx\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}\right)^\top\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}\right)+ c \right),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mu} \in \R^2$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\in \R^{2\times 2}$ is a symmetric and positive semidefinite covariance matrix. As noise PDF is chosen 
$\psi\left(\boldsymbol{e}\right)=\pazocal{N}\left(\boldsymbol{e}; \boldsymbol{\mu}_1,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1\right)$, where $\boldsymbol{\mu}_1 = \left(2,2\right)^\top$ and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_1=10\cdot\mathbb{I}_2$. Figure \ref{ex:NCE_2} shows the results in a similar vein to the previous case.
